Stratification Summary
----------------------

Segmental Duplication Region BED files are from the [T2T Consortium](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup).

These files are developed to identify miscellaneous difficult regions. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into whether they are in segmental duplications.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------
#### File List:  
CHM13v2.0_SegDups.bed.gz
CHM13v2.0_notinSegDups.bed.gz

#### File Descriptions:
- `CHM13v2.0_SegDups.bed.gz`  
The T2T SDs file for CHM13v2.0 was used.

- `notin`  
are non-overlapping complements of the stratification regions (i.e., genome after excluding the regions).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:

The CHM13v2.0 Segmental Duplications file (`T2T-CHM13v2.SDs.lowid.bed`) provided by the T2T Consortium was sorted and merged in the `T2T-CHM13v2.0-SegDups.ipynb`.

Dependencies:

`T2T-CHM13v2.SDs.lowid.bed`  
Transferred 20220301 via [globus web interface](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=9db1f0a6-a05a-11ea-8f06-0a21f750d19b&origin_path=%2Fteam-segdups%2FAssembly_analysis%2FSEDEF%2F) (/team-segdups/Assembly_analysis/SEDEF/T2T-CHM13v2.SDs.lowid.bed)to T2T_files/) 

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.  Post processing included sorting, merging and subsetting to chromosomes 1-22, X and Y followed by file compression. 

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage for CHM13v2.0 was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage was as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the HG002 HPRC.cur.20211005 (trio hifiasm diploid assembly) draft-benchmark to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
