**Title of Dataset:**  
CHM13v2.0 Union BED files

Stratification Summary
----------------------

Union BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team, the [Genome in a Bottle Consortium](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) and the [T2T Consortium](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup).

These files are developed by taking the union of the more granular difficult regions bed files. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into whether they are in or not in different general types of difficult regions or in any type of difficult region or complex variant. For example, performance can be measured in just the "easy" regions of the genome.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------
#### File List:
CHM13v2.0_alldifficultregions.bed.gz  
CHM13v2.0_notinalldifficultregions.bed.gz   

#### File Descriptions:
- `CHM13v2.0_alldifficultregions.bed.gz`  
union of all tandem repeats, all homopolymers >6bp, rDNA, all segmental duplication and chrX/Y XTR regions and satellites.

- `notin`  
complement regions are non-overlapping genomic regions that remain after excluding stratification regions.  

--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:

All other "Union" stratifications files were generated in `T2T-CHM13v2.0-Union.ipynb`

Union stratifications were generated using [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) multiIntersectBed, sortBed, mergeBed and subtractBed. 

Dependencies:  

Information on input files can be found in READMEs for the following stratification types:
- OtherDifficult
- LowComplexity
- SegDups
- XY

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.  Post processing included sorting, merging and subsetting to chromosomes 1-22, X and Y followed by file compression. 

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage comparison between CHM13v2.0 and GRCh3X BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the HG002 HPRC.cur.20211005 (trio hifiasm diploid assembly) draft-benchmark to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
--------------------------

#### File structure: 
All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.
