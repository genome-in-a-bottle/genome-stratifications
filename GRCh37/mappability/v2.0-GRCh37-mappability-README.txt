Stratification Summary
----------------------

Mappability BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls based on genomic region short read mappability using the GEM mappability tool. 

The GEM mappability tool finds l-bp regions that match other regions in the reference genome with fewer than m mismatches (SNPs) and fewer than ‘e’ indels < 15bp.  To generate these files, we used the GRCh37 fasta from 1000genomes.org without decoy sequences (human_g1k_v37.fasta). 

We generated mappability files for 100 bp (l100) and 250 bp (l250) single-end reads, allowing:
a) 0 mismatches and 0 indels (m0_e0)
d) 2 mismatches and 1 indels (m2_e1)
 
The bed files ending in “_nonuniq.sort.bed” contain only regions that are “unmappable”, meaning they have any homologous regions in the reference genome for the given read length, number of mismatches, and number of indels.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File list: 
Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

- human_g1k_v37_gemmap_l100_m2_e1_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz	GRCh37_nonunique_l100_m2_e1.bed.gz: non-mappable regions for l100_m2_e1 GEM parameters
- human_g1k_v37_gemmap_l250_m0_e0_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz	GRCh37_nonunique_l250_m0_e0.bed.gz: non-mappable regions for l250_m0_e0 GEM parameters
- lowmappabilityall.bed.gz	GRCh37_lowmappabilityall.bed.gz: The union of non-mappable regions
- notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz	GRCh37_notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz: The complement of lowmappabilityall.bed.gz

File Structure: All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.

Version Changes: To reduce the total number of stratifications for V2.0 of the stratifications only two mappability files (parameter sets: l-100, m-2, e-1; and l-250, m-0, e-0) are included. These stratifications represent the most (l-250, m-0, e-0) and least (l-100, m-2, e-1) stringent stratifications.


--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:
Regions with low mappability for different read lengths and error rates were generated using GEM and bedops.
Two sets of parameters where used representing low and high stringency short read mappability.

__Parameters__

- low stringency: l-100, m-2, e-1
- high stringency: l-250, m-0, e-0

The bash script `run_GEM_mappability.sh` was used to generate the raw mappability files and the `make_all_and_notin_beds.sh` script was used to  generate the union stratification (`lowmappabilityall.bed.gz`) and its complement ('notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz'). The script `run_GEM_mappability_sort.sh` was previously used for generation of v1.0 GEM mappability stratifications and union files and is provided as a reference.

Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Quality-Assurance: Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
