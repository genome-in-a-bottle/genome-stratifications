Stratification Summary
----------------------

Functional Technically Difficult BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different functional or potentially functional regions that are also likely to be technically difficult to sequence.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------
#### File List:
GRCh37_BadPromoters.bed.gz\
GRCh37_CMRGv1.00_duplicationinKMT2C.bed.gz\
GRCh37_CMRGv1.00_falselyduplicatedgenes.bed.gz

#### File Descriptions:

- `GRCh3X_BadPromoters.bed.gz`\
Identified transcription start sites or first exons that have systematically low coverage as described in ["Characterizing and measuring bias in sequence data"](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51)

- `GRCh3X_CMRGv1.00_duplicationinKMT2C.bed.gz`\
regions of KMT2C that are duplicated in most or all individuals relative to GRCh37 and GRCh38

- `GRCh3X_CMRGv1.00_falselyduplicatedgenes.bed.gz`\
genes that are falsely duplicated in GRCh37 (MRC1 and part of CNR2) and GRCh38 (CBS, CRYAA, KCNE1, and H19)

--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:

`GRCh3X_BadPromoters.bed.gz` was generated from the list of [difficult-to-sequence promoters](http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt) from the paper ["Characterizing and measuring bias in sequence data"](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51).  In the paper Ross *et al.* described these regions as:

*Anecdotal results suggested that many transcription start sites or first exons in the human genome tend to have poor coverage. By a systematic analysis of these regions we defined the 1,000 with the lowest relative coverage based on low coverage by an Illumina data set, which we term the 'bad promoters' list (see Materials and methods). The bad promoters are, like many exons, GC-rich (averaging 79% GC composition).*

Falsely duplicated and KMT2C regions were identified during evaluation of the Challenging Medically Relevant Genes Benchmark (CMRG v1.00). From the manual curation of common false positives, false negatives, and genotyping errors, we also identified some categories of variants where the benchmark correctly identified errors in the majority of callsets.  

For `GRCh3X_CMRGv1.00_falselyduplicatedgenes.bed.gz` the script `MRG_falsely_duplicated.sh` was used to extract the falsely duplicated regions from the CMRG benchmark bed. 

`GRCh3X_CMRGv1.00_duplicationinKMT2C.bed.gz` is the region of KMT2C that was identified as being duplicated during CMRG benchmark evaluation. 	 

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.   A file crosswalk is provided in the post-processing directory for use in correlating script file naming and files generated in post-processing. 

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the v4.2.1 GIAB benchmark set to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected.

#### File structure: 
All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.
