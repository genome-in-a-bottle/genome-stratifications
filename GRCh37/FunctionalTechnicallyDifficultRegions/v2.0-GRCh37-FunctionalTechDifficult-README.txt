Stratification Summary
----------------------

These GRCh37 Functional Technically Difficult BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files are intended as standard resource of BED files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different functional or potentially functional regions that are also likely to be technically difficult to sequence. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File list:

Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate :
The GRCh37 BadPromoters_gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.bed.gz was generated from the list of difficult-to-sequence promoters (http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt) from the paper http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/5/R51 (doi:10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51).  In the paper they are described as:
“Anecdotal results suggested that many transcription start sites or first exons in the human genome tend to have poor coverage. By a systematic analysis of these regions we defined the 1,000 with the lowest relative coverage based on low coverage by an Illumina data set, which we term the 'bad promoters' list (see Materials and methods). The bad promoters are, like many exons, GC-rich (averaging 79% GC composition).”

Post Processing of all files:
Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb" 

Dependencies: 
difficult-to-sequence promoters (http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt)

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

File structure:
All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.
