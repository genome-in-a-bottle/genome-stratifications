Stratification Summary
----------------------
Functional Region BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. 

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls inside and outside of coding regions.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------
#### File List:
GRCh37_notinrefseq_cds.bed.gz  
GRCh37_refseq_cds.bed.gz

#### File Descriptions:

- `GRCh3X_refseq_cds.bed.gz`  
Genomic regions within coding regions

- `GRCh3X_notinrefseq_cds.bed.gz`  
Genomic regions outside coding regions.

--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:
The coding regions were extracted from the RefSeq GFF file `GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13_genomic.gff.gz` using the `create_GRCh37_cds_bed.Rmd` 

`notin` complement regions are non-overlapping genomic regions that remain after excluding stratification regions. The genomic reference BED files noted in associated scripts were created manually to include the entirety of each chromosome in each reference and are used to generate `notin` regions. 

#### Dependencies:
- [RefSeq GFF input file](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13_genomic.gff.gz)
	- GFF input MD5: e84f4e0102b6c4f4cc0035b8abf1038f
- [RefSeq FeatureTable](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13_feature_table.txt.gz)
	- FeatureTable input MD5: c0587443810e3d62da505fb653c28dd3

#### Software:
- R packages: tidyverse
- Command line tools: bedtools, bgzip, samtools

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.   A file crosswalk is provided in the post-processing directory for use in correlating script file naming and files generated in post-processing. 

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the v4.2.1 GIAB benchmark set to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
--------------------------

#### File structure: 
All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.
