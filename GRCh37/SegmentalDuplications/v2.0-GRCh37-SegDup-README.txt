Stratification Summary
----------------------

Segmental duplication and self chain BED files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are derived from the UCSC hg19 chainSelf, chainSelfLink and genomicSuperDups genome tracks. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into whether they are in segmental duplications or in regions with non-trivial self-chain alignments. Non-trivial self-chains are regions where another part of the genome aligns to it because the sequences are similar (e.g., due to genomic duplication events). Further information on UCSC tracks can be found at https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables.

**IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING UCSC chainSelf: There were substantial differences between the self chains downloaded for GRCh37 and GRCh38, which we do not fully understand, so we recommend using these with care  For this reason the self chain files were not used in preparation of union files. **

File list:

Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

Relationship between files, if important for context:  
**chainSelf_gt10kb** and **segdups_gt10kb** are the **chainSelf** and **segdups** files filtered to regions greater than 10kb. Filenames with **notin** are complement of the stratification regions (i.e., genome after excluding the regions).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate : 

The self-chain and segdups stratification BEDs were generated from UCSC input files and processed. 

Methods for processing the data: 

Scripts for the following files can be found in Jupyter notebook GRCh37_new_chainSelf_and_Segdups.ipynb:

GRCh37_gt5segdups_gt10kb_gt99percidentity.bed.gz
GRCh37_notinchainSelf.bed.gz
GRCh37_notinchainSelf_gt10kb.bed.gz
GRCh37_notinsegdups.bed.gz
GRCh37_notinsegdups_gt10kb.bed.gz
GRCh37_segdups.bed.gz
GRCh37_segdups_gt10kb.bed.gz

Scripts for GRCh37_gt5segdups_gt10kb_gt99percidentity.bed.gz are in GRCh37_Generating_v4.1_excluded_beds.ipynb


SelfChain
The chainSelf and chainSelfLink files were retrieved from the UCSC golden path. To generate a self chain bed that describes non-trivial alignments of the genome reference to itself (excluding ALT loci), we used both the chainSelf and chainSelfLink files from UCSC, matching the IDs in the two files and only using the regions with base-level alignments (i.e., excluding gaps between chained alignments). We then merged overlapping regions and regions separated by <100bp.  An additional self chain output was filtered to yield only regions that are greater than 10kb.  

Segmental Duplications
The genomicSuperDups file was processed to remove all but chromosomes 1-22, X and Y and overlapping regions merged using bedtools An additional segmental duplication output was filtered to yield only regions that are greater than 10kb. We further subset to regions >10kb covered by more than 5 segmental duplications with >99% identity in GRCh37_gt5segdups_gt10kb_gt99percidentity.bed.gz

Post Processing of all files:
Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
