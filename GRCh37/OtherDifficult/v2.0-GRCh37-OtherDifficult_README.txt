Stratification Summary
----------------------

Other Difficult Region BED files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are developed to identify miscellaneous difficult regions. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into whether they are in difficult regions such as the VDJ, MHC, near gaps in the reference, or in errors in the reference.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File descriptions:
- GRCh37_contigs_lt500kb.bed.gz: reference contains <500kb in size
- GRCh37_gaps_slop15kb.bed.gz: 15kb flanking regions of gaps in the reference 
- GRCh37_hg38_minimap2_asm20_N10_gt1contig_gt1kb.bed.gz: GRCh37 regions covered by >1 contig from GRCh38 using minimap2
- GRCh37_hg38_minimap2_asm20_N10_nocovgt1kb.bed.gz: GRCh37 regions covered by no contigs from GRCh38 using minimap2 
- GRCh37_hs37d5_decoy_alignments.bed.gz: alignments of the hs37d5 decoy sequences to GRCh37, potentially duplicated regions
- GRCh37_MHC.bed.gz: Major Histocompatibility Complex (including HLA genes) 
- GRCh37_missing_and_multiple_alignments_of_GRCh38.bed.gz: GRCh37 regions covered by >1 contig or no contigs from GRCh38 as defined by GRC as SP or SPonly
- GRCh37_VDJ.bed.gz: T cell and B cell VDJ regions that somatically recombine
- GRCh37_allOtherDifficultregions.bed.gz: union of above regions

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Methods for processing the data: 
Most files were generated in Jupyter notebook GRCh37_Generating_v4.1_excluded_beds.ipynb. GRCh37_allOtherDifficultregions.bed.gz was generated from the Merged_difficult_regions.sh and the MHC_GRCh37.bed.gz was generated using conventional coordinates from the Genome Reference Consortium (chr6:28,477,797-33,448,354).

Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb" 

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
