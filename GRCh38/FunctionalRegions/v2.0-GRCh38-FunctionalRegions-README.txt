Stratification Summary
----------------------
FunctionalRegion BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files are intended as a standard resource BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls inside and outside of coding regions for specific benchmark genomes like NA12878/HG001 and the GIAB AJ and Chinese Trios.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File list:
Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

- GRCh38_refseq_cds_merged.bed.gz	GRCh38_refseq_cds.bed.gz: genomic positions inside coding regions
- notin_GRCh38_refseq_cds_merged.bed.gz	GRCh38_notinrefseq_cds.bed.gz: genomic positions outside coding regions

Relationship between files: GRCh38_refseq_cds.bed.gz and GRCh37_notinrefseq_union_cds.bed.gz are non-overlapping complements.

File Structure: All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.

Version Changes: GRCh38 stratifications are new to the V2.0 stratification set.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:
The coding regions were extracted from the RefSeq GFF file `GCF_000001405.39_GRCh38.p13_genomic.gff.gz` using the `create_GRCh38_cds_bed.Rmd` available at github [url, commit tag].

Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Quality-Assurance: Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
