Stratification Summary
----------------------
Low Complexity BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the  [Genome in a Bottle Consortium](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle).

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into regions with different types and sizes of low complexity sequence (e.g., homopolymers, STRs, VNTRs, other locally repetitive sequences).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:

All Stratfications generated in python notebook `GRCh38_LowComplexity.ipynb`.

To capture the full spectrum of repeats, we used a python script to find exact repeats and UCSC RepeatMasker Low_Complexity, UCSC RepeatMasker Simple_Repeats, and UCSC TRF Low_Complexity.

To create bed files with perfect 1, 2, 3, and 4 bp repeats of lengths, we used the python script `findSimpleRegions_quad.py` (created by Geoff Nilsen, and modified by Justin Zook to output 4-bp repeats).

`notin` complement regions are non-overlapping genomic regions that remain after excluding stratification regions. The genomic reference BED files noted in associated scripts were created manually to include the entirety of each chromosome in each reference and are used to generate `notin` regions. 

`GRCh3X_SimpleRepeat_homopolymer_gt20_slop5.bed.gz` and `GRCh3X_SimpleRepeat_imperfecthomopolgt20_slop5.bed.gz` regions were identified during manual curation of Medically Relevant Gene Benchmark and accounted for a majority of false negatives and false positives for both SNPs and INDELs. 

`GRCh3X_satellites_slop5.bed.gz` contains "Satellite" regions from UCSC RepeatMasker.

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.  Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged, sorted and compressed and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y.  

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37, GRCh38 and CHM13v2.0 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the HG002 HPRC.cur.20211005 (trio hifiasm diploid assembly) draft-benchmark to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected.
