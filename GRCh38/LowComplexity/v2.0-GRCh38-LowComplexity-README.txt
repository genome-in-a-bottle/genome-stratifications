Stratification Summary
----------------------
Low Complexity BED files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These BED files are developed to identify difficult regions due to different types and sizes of low complexity sequence (e.g., homopolymers, STRs, VNTRs, other locally repetitive sequences).

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File descriptions:
- SimpleRepeat*: Perfect repeats of different unit sizes (i.e., homopolymers, and dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and quadnucleotide STRs) and different total repeat lengths (i.e., <=50bp, 51-200bp, or >200bp)
- SimpleRepeat_imperfecthomopolgt10_slop5.bed.gz: Perfect homopolymers >10bp as well as imperfect homopolymers where a single base was repeated >10bp except for a 1bp interruption by a different base
- AllTandemRepeats_*: union of SimpleRepeat dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and quadnucleotide STRs as well as RepeatMasker_LowComplexity, RepeatMasker_SimpleRepeats, and TRF_SimpleRepeats downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser
- AllHomopolymers_gt6bp_imperfectgt10bp_slop5.bed.gz: union of all perfect homopolymers >6bp and imperfect homopolymers >10bp
- AllTandemRepeatsandHomopolymers_slop5.bed.gz: union of AllTandemRepeats_* with AllHomopolymers_gt6bp_imperfectgt10bp_slop5.bed.gz

Updates in v2:
1. RepeatMasker and TRF_SimpleRepeats downloaded from UCSC for hg19 and hg38 on 7/22/19. These replace the TRDB repeats that were used in the 2015 version, since the 2015 version missed some long, imperfect tandem repeats.
2. Exact repeats with fewer than 5 copies of the tandem repeat unit (e.g., <15bp total length for trinucleotide STRs) were now ignored, since these tend to have low sequencing error rates.
3. Homopolymer lengths were incorrectly labeled, 1bp lower than the actual size, in the previous version
4. Fixed the SimpleRepeat_imperfecthomopolgt10_slop5.bed.gz to only merge adjacent homopolymers if they had the same base repeated
5. All beds have 5bp slop added on each side to capture variants at the edge of the repeats (sometimes insertions were not captured properly before in stratifications)

Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate: 
To capture the full spectrum of repeats, we used a python script to find exact repeats and UCSC RepeatMasker Low_Complexity, UCSC RepeatMasker Simple_Repeats, and UCSC TRF Low_Complexity

Methods for processing the data: Beds generated by FindSimpleRepeats_GRCh38_v2.sh. To create bed files with perfect 1, 2, 3, and 4 bp repeats of lengths, we used the python script findSimpleRegions_quad.py in this directory (created by Geoff Nilsen, and modified by Justin Zook to output 4-bp repeats).

Post Processing of all files:
Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Dependencies: 
UCSC RepeatMasker and TRF_SimpleRepeats downloaded 20190722

Software- or Instrument-specific information needed to interpret the data, including software and hardware version numbers:

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
