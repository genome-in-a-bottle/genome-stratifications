Stratification Summary
----------------------

These GRCh38 Genome Specific BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files are intended as standard resource of BED files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different functional or potentially functional regions that are also likely to be technically difficult to sequence. These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify.

The initial GRCh37 file was created by Justin Zook at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The GRCh38 BED file presented here is remapped from the GRCh37 BED file.

File list:

Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate :

The GRCh37 BadPromoters_gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.bed.gz was generated from the list of difficult-to-sequence promoters (http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt) from the paper http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/5/R51 (doi:10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51).  This GRCh37 file was then remapped to GRCh38 using the NCBI remapping service. 

Methods for stratification file generation (generated by Justin Zook):

The GRCh37 BadPromoters_gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.bed.gz was generated from the list of difficult-to-sequence promoters (http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt) from the paper http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/5/R51 (doi:10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51).  In the paper they are described as:
“Anecdotal results suggested that many transcription start sites or first exons in the human genome tend to have poor coverage. By a systematic analysis of these regions we defined the 1,000 with the lowest relative coverage based on low coverage by an Illumina data set, which we term the 'bad promoters' list (see Materials and methods). The bad promoters are, like many exons, GC-rich (averaging 79% GC composition).”

Remapping Methods (performed by Jennifer McDaniel): 

The GRCh37 Functionally Technically Difficult BED file was remapped to GRCh38 using the NCBI Remapping Service. 

On 5/30/19 remap of the GRCh37 BadPromoters_gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.bed.gz file (see below) was performed with the NCBI Remapping Service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap). This service projects .bed coordinates from GRCh37 to GRCh38.  

Prior to remap the GRCh37 BED file was trimmed to three fields to include chromosome number, start position and stop position. The trimmed bed file was input for remap using the following parameters:
Source =GRCh37.p13::primary assembly (2/27/09)
Target = GRCh38.p11::primary assembly (12/20/13)

Default remapping options were used:
Minimum ratio of bases that must be remapped = 0.5
Minimum ratio for difference between source length and target length = 2.0
Allow multiple locations to be returned = yes
Merge Fragments = yes

Post Processing of all files:
Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Software- or Instrument-specific information needed to interpret the data, including software and hardware version numbers: 
NCBI Remapping Service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap)

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
