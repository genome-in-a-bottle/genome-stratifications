----------------------
Stratification Summary
----------------------
Mappability BED files are from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.

These files are intended as a standard resource BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as hap.py to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls based on genomic region short read mappability.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
--------------------

File List:

Following file generation output files from scripts were renamed using a common convention. Below is a crosswalk of the output filename from the file generation scripts followed by the renamed filename in v2.0 release and description of file. 
[script output filename][renamed v2.0 filename] : stratification description

- GRCh38_no_alt_gemmap_l100_m2_e1_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz	GRCh38_nonunique_l100_m2_e1.bed.gz : unmappable regions for l100_m2_e1 parameter set
- GRCh38_no_alt_gemmap_l250_m0_e0_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz	GRCh38_nonunique_l250_m0_e0.bed.gz : unmappable regions for l250_m0_e0 parameter set
- lowmappabilityall.bed.gz	GRCh38_lowmappabilityall.bed.gz : The union of GRCh38_no_alt_gemmap_l100_m2_e1_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz and GRCh38_no_alt_gemmap_l250_m0_e0_nonuniq.sort.bed.gz
- notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz	GRCh38_notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz : The complement of lowmappabilityall.bed.gz

File Structure: All stratification files are standard 3-field BED files (chromosome, start, end) with header.

Version Changes: To reduce the total number of stratifications for V2.0 of the stratifications only two mappability files (parameter sets: l-100, m-2, e-1; and l-250, m-0, e-0) are included. These stratifications represent the most (l-250, m-0, e-0) and least (l-100, m-2, e-1) stringent stratifications.


--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:
Regions with low mappability for different read lengths and error rates were generated using GEM and bedops.
Two sets of parameters where used representing low and high stringency short read mappability.

__Parameters__

- low stringency: l-100, m-2, e-1
- high stringency: l-250, m-0, e-0

The bash script `run_GEM_mappability_GRCh38.sh` was used to generate the raw mappability files and the `run_GEM_mappability_sort_GRCh38.sh` script was used to reformat the resulting bed and generate the union stratification (`lowmappabilityall.bed.gz`) and its complement ('notinlowmappabilityall.bed.gz'). The scripts are available at github [url, commit tag].

Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps and pseudoautosomal Y regions. The BEDs are merged and sorted and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y. These are a 3-field BED (chromosome, start, end) that contains a header.  Post processing scripts can be found in "Prepare Stratification BEDs for GitHub.ipynb"

Quality-Assurance: Coverage comparison between GRCh37 and GRCh38 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected.
