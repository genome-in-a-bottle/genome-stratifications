Stratification Summary
----------------------

XY genomic feature regions were provided by [Melissa Wilson](http://www.sexchrlab.org) from Arizona State University, School of Life Sciences.

These files can be used as standard resource of BED files for use with GA4GH benchmarking tools such as [hap.py](https://github.com/Illumina/hap.py) to stratify true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into whether they are in chromosome X and Y specific regions.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

#### Description of methods used to generate the stratifications:

All XY stratifications files were generated using Linux commands found in `GRCh38-XY.ipynb`

X/Y XTR and ampliconic regions were provided by Melissa Wilson and were parsed from `chr<X/Y>_genomic_features_GRCh38.bed`

PAR-X stratification regions, `hs38.PAR.bed`, was provided by Heng Li.

PAR-Y stratification regions, `PSA_Y_GRCh38.bed`, are from the USCS Genome Browser.

#### Post Processing of all files:
Post-processing for file consistency was performed and described in GitHub post-processing directory.  Stratification BED(s) were post processed to remove reference Ns, specifically gaps. The BEDs are merged, sorted and compressed and only contain chromosomes 1-22, X and Y, as appropriate, followed by file compression.  

#### Quality-Assurance of all files:
Coverage comparison between GRCh37, GRCh38 and CHM13v2.0 BED files was performed for each chromosome using R. We confirmed coverage between the BEDs were as expected. Validation of chromosome coverage can be found in the GitHub validation directory. Benchmarking of a HiFi-DeepVariant callset was also performed using stratifications with hap.py.  Callset was benchmarked against the HG002 HPRC.cur.20211005 (trio hifiasm diploid assembly) draft-benchmark to ensure benchmarking statistics in these regions were as expected. 

#### People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:
[Melissa Wilson](http://www.sexchrlab.org), Arizona State University  
Heng Li (Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA) contributed PAR-X regions.
