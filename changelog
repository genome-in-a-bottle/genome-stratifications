# V2.0
Major enhancements:  

- Bed files for GRCh37 as well as GRCh38  
- Improved coverage of low complexity regions  
- Merged files covering all difficult regions as well as bed files for relatively easy regions  
- Additional difficult regions like the MHC, VDJ, and errors in the GRCh37 reference  
- Genome-specific files for complex variants and SVs in HG002 used in our v4.1 small variant benchmark  

The Bed files and tsv files for use with hap.py when doing benchmarking are at 
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v2.0/. 
An archived version of the code and stratifications is available at https://doi.org/10.18434/M32190 (Which will be active soon).
